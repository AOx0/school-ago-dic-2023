    - Pings to the web server and PC-01 were successful
    - Pings to PC-A and PC-B failed

+ Can PC-02 access www.cisco.pka? Using the web server IP address?

== PC-03

+ Were the pings successful?

  *A*: Can only ping to local machines, but cant reach the router even when the configuration on the PC
  for the default gateway is correct.

+ Can PC-02 access www.cisco.pka? Using the web server IP address?

  *A* No, no

+ To fix it we can ssh into the router with a machine that can reach it. If we write `show ip interface brief`
  we can notice theres a wrong ip for interface GigabitEthernet 0/1.
